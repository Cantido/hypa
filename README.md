Useful functions for Elixir applications using [htmx].

Offers a `Plug` that performs a few tasks:

- Parses `HX-*` headers into `conn.assigns`
- Adds HTMX to your cache-control headers
- Controls the rendering of layouts, hiding them for HTMX requests while showing them for non-HTMX requests.

[htmx]: https://htmx.org

## Installation

This library is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/hypa), and the package can be installed
by adding `hypa` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do

    {:hypa, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/hypa>.

## Usage
